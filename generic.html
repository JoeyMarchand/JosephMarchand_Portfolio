								<p>I am graduating from the University of Minnesota Duluth with a Master of Science in Chemistry. Unlike a traditional chemistry degree, my master’s program is heavily focused on data science, combining exploratory data analysis (EDA) of environmental data with the development of neural networks trained on large-scale datasets. I began my master’s program with experience in R, but as I started working with massive datasets, I quickly expanded my skill set to include Python and SQL to better manage, analyze, and model complex data. </p>
								<p>During my master’s program, I gained experience with a wide range of coding applications across different domains. One example is my work with the GeoPandas library, where I plotted analytical data alongside spatial analysis of land use imagery. Additionally, I worked extensively with Scikit-learn, applying various machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, principal component analysis (PCA), K-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering, among others. This experience has equipped me with a diverse set of analytical tools and highlights my ability to quickly learn new libraries and techniques, and effectively apply them to complex data problems in a timely manner. </p>
